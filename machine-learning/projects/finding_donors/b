Problems regarding predict proba function

You can look @ this notebook to get idea about how minibatching is done. This is the easiest way to do it. Of course, you have to select a model that can be trained in batches. [05 PM]

Initial Model Evaluation: Interpreting my results

It is very hard to make statements like which model is best based on just one run. You should think of the results as just a sample point in a distribution i.e the results are for that combination of data, for that data set etc. Usually, RandomForest is a much more powerful and versatile algorithm t…

Initial Model Evaluation: Interpreting my results

it’s possible. Zero F-score means it misclassified all the points of the class that you were interested in. 1% of the data is really not a lot of data. In other words, you can say that SVC needs more data than other classifiers before it can start performing better.

If there are small changes I wouldn’t be too worried about it. With less data, the same models can overfit and give very good accuracy on the training set. What’s your concern with the F-Score?

Something is not right for sure. However, you are getting into accidents and your reward is consistently negative. You are correct you should be getting ‘F’ on both metrics. Weird!

Question 1: calculating accuracy and F-score without predictions
 Project: Finding Donors for CharityML
Yes. That is correct. Also, you are just asked to calculate accuracy and recall so you don’t even need to create a predicted vector. All you need to know is all the labels are one and you can use that information directly in the forumulas.

Lesson 3 Step 3: Single Link Clustering Running Time
 Clustering
But how would you just pick points based on distances you got the first time. Once a point enters a cluster even if it is far away from some other point, its distance from that point will be closest distance from any point in that cluster. Here is a concrete example: Let’s say you have 3 points A…

Is there a reason that the reward has a random portion in it?
 Project: Train a Smartcab to Drive
I don’t think it should matter too much. It just adds or subtracts decimals from the actual reward. I am not sure what the reasoning behind it was or if there is any ML aspect to it (I don’t think there is.) I think the person who wrote the code just wanted the final rewards to look like floats an…

Lesson 3 Step 3: Single Link Clustering Running Time
 Clustering
OK. Fine. Steps 1, 2, 3 have to be repeated. So every time you add a point to a cluster you need to update the distances (and you could use tricks to optimize the calculations, such as using the distance that you had computed the first time.) then you would need to sort again since you have updated…

Lesson 3 Step 3: Single Link Clustering Running Time

The step 2 does need to be repeated. However, there are a lot of optimizations within the step so that you do not need to do the entire step 2 every time. For example, once a point is added to a cluster, distances from all points in that cluster to all the other points not in that cluster can be upd…

Why does the area bounded by a decision tree look like that?
 MLND: Intro and Fundamentals
Yes. That is correct. The Decision tree cuts the plane in two halves with a decision point. So if the plane shown was an XY plane the decision tree could be: Y > a X < b Y > c X > d and you would pretty soon have the plane cut into squares/rectangles.

Lesson 3 Step 3: Single Link Clustering Running Time

Your idea is correct. However, you would need to repeat steps 2 and 3 K times. Once you form a cluster the closest distance between all the points may need to be updated because the closest distance from a point A to any other point B will be the closest distance from the cluster that point A belong…

Problem - one hot encoding for 1000 unique values
 MLND: Supervised Learning
LabelEncoder is the best method I can think of that you should use. Archit shared a link in this post but of those, all LabelEncoder does everything that the other methods do. You just have to remember to save the mapping and be able to recover it back when you use the LabelEncoder.

Yes. The data you use to predict has to match in feature size the data that you used to train the model. Instead of one hot encoding you can use labelencoder to encode the data within the same column.

ValueError in choose_action method
 Project: Train a Smartcab to Drive
Yes. Good point. That is an issue. And also you were missing the ‘state’, for example self.Q.values() will return in a list all the dictionaries for all the states you have. I think you probably wanted self.Q[state].values()

Model Tuning: 'numpy.float64' object is not callable
 Project: Finding Donors for CharityML
@kiyo921, You may have too many grid search parameters. It’s easy to get carried away, but a just a few parameters and a few values for those parameters will blow up the combinations of the values that it needs to search. It is building a model for each of those parameter combinations. So make sure…

Does Oncoming Traffic Really Necessary?
 MLND: Reinforcement Learning
Personally, if your code works just with those two state axes, lights and waypoint and works for 1000 trials getting A+, that is a pretty strong statement that those two are the only ones that are important. But, that is an indication that the rewards system in the environment.py is screwed up and …

Why is PCA associated with unsupervised learning only?
 MLND: Unsupervised Learning
Yes. True. It is not a “learning algorithm” but it is “unsupervised” in the sense it does not need labels to work. This is one of those things where everyone gets a participation trophy because it is subjective and who is to say one person’s interpretation is “more correct” than someone else’s. Th…

Yes. Very good indeed. So the permutation just returns a list of numbers upto the range that you have given it. X and Y are related. X is the features DF and Y is the label. So they will have the same number of records. So if you did X.shape and Y.shape and printed them out the first number will b…

Why is PCA associated with unsupervised learning only?

Can you share the answers you found? PCA is deemed an unsupervised algorithm itself because it can work only one set of vectors and produce a new set of vectors i.e it does not need to be trained. But it can be used in supervised learning. Here are some slides I found after I was googling based on …

It is very hard to make statements like which model is best based on just one run.

Initial Model Evaluation: Interpreting my results
 Project: Finding Donors for CharityML
it’s possible. Zero F-score means it misclassified all the points of the class that you were interested in. 1% of the data is really not a lot of data. In other words, you can say that SVC needs more data than other classifiers before it can start performing better.

Initial Model Evaluation: Interpreting my results

If there are small changes I wouldn’t be too worried about it. With less data, the same models can overfit and give very good accuracy on the training set. What’s your concern with the F-Score?

Question 1: calculating accuracy and F-score without predictions

Yes. That is correct. Also, you are just asked to calculate accuracy and recall so you don’t even need to create a predicted vector. All you need to know is all the labels are one and you can use that information directly in the forumulas.

Lesson 3 Step 3: Single Link Clustering Running Time

But how would you just pick points based on distances you got the first time. Once a point enters a cluster even if it is far away from some other point, its distance from that point will be closest distance from any point in that cluster. Here is a concrete example: Let’s say you have 3 points A…

Is there a reason that the reward has a random portion in it?

I don’t think it should matter too much. It just adds or subtracts decimals from the actual reward. I am not sure what the reasoning behind it was or if there is any ML aspect to it (I don’t think there is.) I think the person who wrote the code just wanted the final rewards to look like floats an…

Lesson 3 Step 3: Single Link Clustering Running Time

OK. Fine. Steps 1, 2, 3 have to be repeated.

The step 2 does need to be repeated. However, there are a lot of optimizations within the step so that you do not need to do the entire step 2 every time.

Why does the area bounded by a decision tree look like that?
 MLND: Intro and Fundamentals
Yes. That is correct. The Decision tree cuts the plane in two halves with a decision point. So if the plane shown was an XY plane the decision tree could be: Y > a X < b Y > c X > d and you would pretty soon have the plane cut into squares/rectangles.

Your idea is correct. However, you would need to repeat steps 2 and 3 K times.
